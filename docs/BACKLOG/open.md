This backlog captures the **active, not-yet-closed** technical work for the
`ai-issue-solver` project. Private personal ideas belong in the separate
private `guido-project-lab` repository and must not be added here.

**Naming & location** (Release 0.7.0 split): this file replaces the old
`docs/NEXT_BACKLOG.md`. Completed items are archived in
[`done.md`](done.md). Long-term direction is in
[`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md).

**Priority** uses numeric ordering: `1` is highest urgency; larger numbers
are lower priority.

**Section numbers** are stable backlog identifiers, not priority. They are
preserved across renames and splits so that GitHub issues, PRs, and external
references keep working. Gaps in the numbering reflect historical insertion
order, not deleted sections.

Create selected items as GitHub issues with:

```bash
python scripts/create_backlog_issues.py --backlog docs/BACKLOG/open.md
python scripts/create_backlog_issues.py --backlog docs/BACKLOG/open.md --apply --confirm-create
```

Clean up completed items after their GitHub issues are closed by moving the
section to [`done.md`](done.md) and running:

```bash
python scripts/cleanup_backlog.py --backlog docs/BACKLOG/open.md
python scripts/cleanup_backlog.py --backlog docs/BACKLOG/open.md --apply --confirm-remove
```

## Priority 1

## 37. Free OpenCode models full integration and evaluation *(parked)*


Labels: `kind/feature`, `theme/workflow`, `agent/solver`, `priority/1`

Parked because: Free OpenCode models full integration and evaluation — not 0.9.0-critical; the hard-coded free-models list is known stale (see agent memory 2026-06-14) and must be re-verified before any real run, not parked as a priority-1 item.

Priority: `1`

Integrate all free OpenCode models into the project's model framework and
evaluate them against the current open issue backlog.

Currently only `opencode/mistral-small-2603`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, and
`gpt-4o` are mentioned in help text; the available free tier models
(`opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free`, `opencode/mimo-v2.5-free`,
`opencode/minimax-m3-free`, `opencode/nemotron-3-ultra-free`) are not
registered anywhere and users cannot discover or select them easily.

Suggested scope:
- add default model names to `MODEL_CONFIGS["opencode"]` so that
  `--model opencode` without `--model-name` picks a sensible default
- add entries in `STRENGTH_MAP` and `COST_TIERS` in `model_selection.py` for
  the free OpenCode models so auto-selection can choose them
- update `benchmark_issues.py` to include the free model list (or make it
  discover them dynamically via `opencode models`)
- run a full benchmark sweep against all open issues (ideally the small,
  low-risk ones first: regression tests, config changes, simple features)
- report per-model: can it solve the issue, does it create a valid PR, do
  tests pass, wall-clock time, and estimated token cost
- if a model consistently fails for a certain class of issues, document the
  pattern and add a model-selection guard in `model_selection.py`
- update `model_selection.py` to support the `opencode` provider family,
  including setting `model` via `--model-name` instead of guessing from
  substring matches
- add a `--list-free-models` (or similar) flag to discover available models
  dynamically via `opencode models` instead of hardcoding them

Touches: `scripts/solve_issues.py`, `scripts/model_selection.py`,
         `scripts/benchmark_issues.py`, `scripts/solver_run_resources.py`

Checks:
- `git diff --check`
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests`

## 39. Periodic documentation benchmark with free OpenCode models *(parked)*


Labels: `kind/automation`, `kind/docs`, `theme/workflow`, `theme/provider`, `priority/2`

Parked because: Periodic documentation benchmark with free OpenCode models — depends on later validation/model-comparison data from 0.9.0; defer until 0.9.0 validation report and free-model registry are stable.

Priority: `2`

Every tenth documentation-only solver run should be executed as a controlled
benchmark across all currently available free OpenCode models. This should keep
model comparison data fresh without spending tokens and provider quota on every
routine documentation issue.

Policy:
- only apply to documentation-only issues with low risk and narrow `Touches:`
  scope
- count successful documentation solver attempts and trigger the benchmark on
  every tenth eligible run
- run all free OpenCode candidates:
  - `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free`
  - `opencode/mimo-v2.5-free`
  - `opencode/minimax-m3-free`
  - `opencode/nemotron-3-ultra-free`
- use isolated branch suffixes and `--skip-pr` while benchmarking candidates
- do not automatically close the issue until the selected candidate is promoted
  and reviewed

Missing functionality to implement:
- persist a documentation-run counter or cadence marker so the scheduler can
  decide when the tenth eligible documentation issue is reached
- add a benchmark trigger mode that runs the free OpenCode models for the same
  documentation issue without requiring manual commands
- rank candidate branches by run outcome, diff relevance, test signal, touched
  files, and worker/runtime health
- promote the best candidate to one draft PR, or record that no candidate was
  good enough
- write durable benchmark comparison data grouped by model, repo type, issue
  type, and failure class
- surface the benchmark comparison in the dashboard, including no-op,
  model-failure, pipeline-failure, preserved-worktree, and promoted-candidate
  states
- record the result so future model selection can learn which free OpenCode
  models work best for documentation, Python, R, dashboard, and mixed repos

Suggested implementation:
- extend `benchmark_issues.py` or add a thin scheduler wrapper around
  `solve_issues.py --skip-pr --branch-suffix`
- reuse `run_outcome` fields from solver reports once available
- add a small persistent state file such as `reports/benchmark-cadence.json`
  or a project status file
- keep the first implementation documentation-only; expand to Python/R only
  after dashboard comparison and recovery semantics are reliable

Touches: `scripts/benchmark_issues.py`, `scripts/solve_issues.py`,
         `scripts/status_dashboard.py`, `scripts/model_selection.py`,
         `reports/`, `tests/`

Checks:
- `git diff --check`
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests`

## 43. First validation pass with N=3 (GitHub #398)

Labels: `kind/analysis`, `kind/feature`, `theme/quality`, `priority/2`

Priority: `2`

First end-to-end run of the validation infrastructure shipped in #326
(PRs #395/#396/#397). Demonstrates that `scripts/validation_run.py
run` actually drives the solver pipeline and produces the report.

Issues to process:
- #386 — chore: cleanup benchmark_issues.py duplicates
- #387 — Add mandatory split-planning step before broad solver runs
- #382 — Consolidate worker execution and health result handling

Run config (proven from #391, #326 v2):
- Model: opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free (free, no billing risk)
- --max-run-cost-usd 5 per run, hard ceiling on total
- --skip-tests --skip-pull (saves preflight time on this env)
- --allow-opencode-state-conflict (CLI 1.15.13 vs stale serve 1.14.28)
- --caffeinate (mac idle sleep)
- Token from config/.env (GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_OWNER, GITHUB_REPO,
  OPENCODE_MODEL, OPENCODE_MODEL_NAME)

Acceptance:
- All 3 issues processed (PR produced OR recorded as no_change).
- Reports/validation/<run-id>.md aggregated from per-issue outcomes.
- Report includes 6 metrics: processed, merged, success rate,
  cost/solved, time/solved, top-5 error classes, totals.

Out of scope:
- Dashboard (Markdown report is the deliverable).
- Cross-repo validation.
- Statistical significance (N=3 is directional).

Definition of Solved (per #326 release-level): an issue counts as
solved if the produced PR was merged AND the merge commit's CI is
green. Anything less is partial.

Touches: scripts/validation_run.py, reports/validation/<run-id>.md,
reports/runs/<run-id>/summary.txt per issue.

Checks:
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests` (regression check)
- `python scripts/validation_run.py --help` lists 4 subcommands
- `python -m compileall scripts tests` clean
- Final report present at `reports/validation/<run-id>.md` with
  all 6 metrics filled
